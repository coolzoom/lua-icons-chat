# LIC - Lua Icons Chat

### Description

    Today I am sharing with you a script I made when my World of Warcraft server was online.
    It is not just a simple WorldChat it is a WorldChat with some very nice features.
    
    1 - You can ping a player in the following way: @PlayerName, so you will send the name of the player in the Chat, his name is clickable and you will have access to the same options as usual.
    2 - You can send emoticons in the chat in the following way: :EmoticonName:, so you will send a nice little image that corresponds to the emoticon you have set up.
    3 - You can send a pre-recorded joke, straight inspired from Overwatch, when you send "#gg", a random phrase will be sent in the WorldChat.
    
    And finally to talk in WorldChat it's very simple, you do "/join world" and WorldChat is active so when you talk in /world you will send a message to all players. 
    
    The part that runs the world is not finished yet, let's say it's a beta, so if you create a custom channel whatever its name, you will still send messages in the world. (/join blabla works just as well)
